Write programs for challenges 1  and 2 and 6 at the end of the chapter on Generics.
1) Write a generic class named MyList, with a type parameter T. The type parameter T should be constrained to an upper bound: the Number class. The class should have as a field an ArrayList of T. Write a public method named add, which accepts a parameter of type T. When an argument is passed to the method, it is added to the ArrayList. Write two other methods, largest and smallest, which return the largest and smallest values in the ArrayList.

2) Modify the MyList class that you wrote for Programming challenge 1(above) so the type parameter T should accept any type that implements the Comparable interface. Test the class in a program that creates one instance of MyList to store Integers, and another instance to store Strings.

6). Highest and Lowest Elements Write a generic class with a type parameter constrained to any type that implements Comparable. The constructor should accept an array of such objects. The class should have methods that return the highest and lowest values in the array. Demonstrate the class in an application.
